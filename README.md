This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews of Disneyland to determine their underlying sentiments. Using TextBlob and NLTK, the text data was preprocessed through techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal. Sentiment scores were then calculated to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

To enhance insights, data visualization techniques were applied, including bar charts and word clouds, allowing clear representation of sentiment distribution and common words used by visitors. The analysis highlights patterns in customer feedback, helping to identify areas of high satisfaction as well as points needing improvement.

Overall, this project demonstrates how sentiment analysis combined with visualization can provide valuable insights into customer experiences and perceptions of Disneyland.
